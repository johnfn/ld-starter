    { speaker: "Detective Pringle", text : "Hey chief, can you give us a quick reminder about what we’re doing here, anyway? Y’know, just so that the “players” of this “game” can get some exposition. Definitely not because I forgot the assignment or anything.", },
    { speaker: "Chief Oberon Nabisco", text : "Fine. This house. It’s empty. Owners died last month. But. The executioner of their will. He filed a report. There’s something missing. An antique mirror. Diamond-studded. Worth maybe $5000. It’s gone. Burglary suspected. Now you two are there. Look for clues. Solve the mystery.", },

    { speaker: "Chief Oberon Nabisco", text : "Stop doing that.", },
